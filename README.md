Exercise 1 for the Engineering Development Academy 3.0: Guess the number.

This game has 2 modes:
1. The Computer picks a random 4-digit number and the Human tries to guess it.
2. The Human picks a random 4-digit number and the Computer tries to guess it.

* good: right digit in the right position
* regular: right digit in the wrong position
